Task 8
My solution so Task 8 is to create a Client set.

In Car Auction class, create a new ArrayList to store Client Objects, and call it clientSet.
This ArrayList, clientSet, will represent a set of Clients, as sets are mathematical structures which contain
no duplicates.

Create a method in Car Auction class, which is a nested for-loop that will do the following:

1) Iterate through all cars in the cars Arraylist in Car Auction.
2) For each car, Iterate through the car's respective Bid Arraylist, and get each bid using the bid's getBid accessor.
3) For each Bid:
  - Get each bit's respective client using the Client class's getClient accessor.
  - Check each Client and compare it with the state of the clientSet ArrayList.
  - If the clientSet Arraylist does not contain the Bid's Client, add the Client to the clientSet ArrayList.
  - If the Bid's Client already exists in clientSet, then skip it. Essentially, do not add it to the
    clientSet ArrayList again.

At the end of the nested loop, the clientSet ArrayList should contain a list of all clients which have no duplicates.
Create another method called printClientSet, which will use a enhanced for-loop to iterate through the clientSet
ArrayList, and print out a list of all clients. This list should not contain any duplicates.

The following solution aims to fulfil Principle B of the Three Design Principles - Classes Should Be Responsible
For Their Own Properties, as each class's respective accessors are used to retrieve the necessary information,
leading up to each Client's information. The following solution also
aims to fulfil Principle C of the Three Design Principles - Avoid Exclusive Use of Literals, as no fixed values
are declared and initialized in this solution. Only one ArrayList, the clientSet ArrayList, is declared and used.
